# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-KNN
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on various tumor characteristics. The model selects the best k-value, trains on labeled data, and evaluates accuracy using different k-values for both full dataset and test dataset performance.
