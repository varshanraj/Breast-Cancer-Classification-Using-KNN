Overview

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on various tumor characteristics. The model selects the best k-value, trains on labeled data, and evaluates accuracy using different k-values for both full dataset and test dataset performance.

Features

✅ Feature Selection – Uses 30+ tumor features for classification.

✅ KNN Model Optimization – Evaluates multiple k values to find the best performance.

✅ Accuracy Analysis – Plots accuracy vs. k to determine optimal neighbors.

✅ Train-Test Split – Splits dataset into 80% training and 20% testing for evaluation.

✅ Predictive Model – Can classify new breast cancer cases based on given tumor features.


Tech Stack

🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

🔹 Machine Learning (KNN Classifier, Model Evaluation)

🔹 Data Visualization (Accuracy vs. k-value plots)

Usage

1️⃣ Load the dataset and preprocess features (X) and labels (y).

2️⃣ Optimize the k value by testing multiple values and plotting accuracy.

3️⃣ Train a KNN classifier with the best k value.

4️⃣ Predict cancer type for new tumor data.

🚀 A simple yet powerful ML model for breast cancer classification!
